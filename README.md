This is some code wrote in Summer 2021, as a project to keep practicing Java with. It has not been majorly updated since then, but I have done basic maintenance to keep it presentable. The last time this project has been modified was January 23rd, 2023, to clean up code.

This project is a game that borrows its design from Smash Bros Brawl and many of its assets from Arknights. It is only intended as a project to practice coding and to present as a show of my coding abilities. None of the images are my own, only the code.


Instructions:
This project can be run from the src/game/Driver.java file.

Player 1's movement keys are WASD, with their attack key being 'f' and their special attack being 'g'.

Player 2's movement keys are the arrow keys, with their attack key being ',' and their special attack being '.'.

The characters have the following special attacks:
 - Shielder can block attacks and other characters
 - Vampire can attack from afar
 - Silverash can land a hit with high knockback and damage


Potential improvements:
 - Better use of git: this project was started when I was unfamiliar with git. Now, many of the work-in-progress sections should be moved to only appear in their own git branches
 - Dictionary usage: I should add dictionaries and use reflection to made object creation neater
 - Distribution of code: I should add files to better distribute the code, instead of having the majority in driver
 - Add characters: more characters could be added, but this is low priority
 - Debug flickering: there is a flickering effect at the start of a match that I need to debug
